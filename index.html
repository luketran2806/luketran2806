            Dear Hiring Manager,
            I would like to introduce myself as a candidate for the Internship position at FM Global. As a generally detail-oriented, analytical, and inquisitive person, I am confident in my ability to perform in this position.

            During my previous roles at Proacure and TikyCorp, I have performed a wide range of market research that relates macro events and their impact on the interest of the company ‚Äì such as COVID-19 and its impact on supply chains and its procurement costs, or China‚Äôs domestic-centric tendencies impacting the cost of sourcing. I‚Äôve also studied legal and political regulatory decisions that could become a point of interest for the company to strategize around or take advantage of. As a Capital Market Analyst intern, I‚Äôve tracked multiple quantitative and qualitative data developments that influenced the price of interested equities, all while efficiently communicating such developments with important parties. From these experiences, I‚Äôve acquired the ability to handle large volumes of data while retaining the accuracy of research and recommendations. As a consulting member and project manager at Optimir Consulting, I have led my team to help clients ‚Äì from all sorts of different business development stages - analyze their pain points and assist their companies through innovative perspectives and evidenced-backed plans of operations. At Nine Oaks LLC, I‚Äôve developed an understanding of the healthcare market and its value supply chain, providing insight into the pain points of the industry and what technologies should be invested in. Through these numerous experiences, I‚Äôve developed a great interest in investment analysis ‚Äì  from how to effectively allocate, manage and gauge assets‚Äô risks and conditions for optimal returns. As such, I am greatly interested in this opportunity. 

            During my academic career, I studied a wide range of topics to support my economics and business administration degree. My college education gave me access to topics such as statistical modeling, macroeconomics, econometrics modeling, financial modeling, risk management, international trade, business management, and more. While working and studying simultaneously, I have drilled in an impeccable work ethic and can meet tight deadlines. 

            Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing more about FM Global and the role.
            Sincerely,
            Triet Tran
